## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Organization**
   - Start with a central concept as the root node
   - Add main topics as first-level children
   - Use colors to group related concepts
   - Keep node labels concise for better readability

2. **Layout**
   - Drag nodes to create a balanced layout
   - Use zoom to focus on specific areas
   - Reset view if the layout becomes too scattered

3. **Performance**
   - Large mind maps (50+ nodes) might become slower
   - Consider breaking complex maps into smaller ones
   - Export to JSON regularly to backup your work
